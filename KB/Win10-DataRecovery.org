#+TITLE: Win10 Data Recovery

If mounting an external HDD taken from an old machine running Windows, NTFS permissions will likely prevent the File Exporer from accessing its files.

Most likely, you'll get an error on entering the user folder "you currently don't have permission to access this folder"
The common wisdom is to modify the filesystem permissions and hope nothing breaks. This is stupid.

File Explorer is total garbage and cannot be run as admin. To explore filesystems properly, install Total Commander and run it as admin.
