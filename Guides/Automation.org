You should always start your automation by finding the biggest pain points or wastes of time and starting there.  Ideal cases are things that:

- Require your specific manual intervention (+3 points)
- Have to happen in an off hour or over the weekend (+5 points)
- Are hard to do, or repetitive  (+5 points)
- Have a nasty penalty if you get them wrong (+6 points)

Add them up and if youâ€™re over 6 automate it
